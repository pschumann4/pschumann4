## Hi, I'm Peter 👋

🌎 I'm a research scientist who currently focuses on environmental toxicology.

🐟 I like to build computational tools that can help us better understand the risks chemicals pose to human and ecological health.

🌱 I'm currently learning how to implement machine learning techniques for improving species susceptibility predictions.

🔭 My scientific interests also include: neuroscience, developmental and regenerative biology, pharmacology, botany, microbiology, and mycology.
