## Hi, I'm Peter 👋

🌎 I'm a researcher focused on developing and improving new approach methodologies (NAMs) for supporting environmental toxicology.
🐟 My work centers on cross-species extrapolation of toxicity information through the use of molecular data.
🌱 Currently, I am using molecular docking and adverse outcome pathway networks to evaluate the ecological hazards of endocrine disrupting compounds.
🔭 My scientific interests also include: neuroscience, developmental and regenerative biology, pharmacology, botany, microbiology, and mycology.
